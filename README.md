# Numerical Solution for ODE

Numerical Analysis class final project consisting of using existing algorithms to solve a system of ordinary differential equations.

Case study: The FitzHugh-Nagumo model of neuronal excitability

The file "ode_project" contains a set of functions implementing different algorithms (explicit methods with fixed step size) and utility functions used through the analysis.

    The experiments can be found in "project.mlx" which a matlab live script or its converted version with extension ".m"
